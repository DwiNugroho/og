# Open Graph Image Generator 😎

![Open Graph Image Generator](https://og.krafan.com/api?title=Open%20Graph%20Image%20Generator%20%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20by%20Krafan&description=Generate%20stuning%20open%20graph%20image%20effortlessly!&information=og.krafan.com)

Yo, welcome to the Open Graph Image Generator! 🚀 This thing makes whipping up Open Graph images a piece of cake. Just toss in your title, description, drop the link to your image, and bam! You got yourself a slick Open Graph image. I built this baby using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and worked some magic with the [@vercel/og](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) library to make it happen.
